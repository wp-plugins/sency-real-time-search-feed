== Description ==


Sency is a real-time search engine. This free service differs from Google in that it's not really a web search engine. It's more of a conversation search engine. The interface mimics a "dressed up Google", but the functionality couldn't be more different.

Sency searches the web (predominately Twitter at this point) for conversations related to your keyword search. Not only does it filter out a lot of the junk that comes through Twitter, it actually separates the most popular links for that search term throughout the day so you can see what's most popular at any given time.

This plugin allows you to easily add and visually customize a stream of conversations related to a keyword search into your widgetized sidebar. The plugin currently allows for multiple streams, but the service only allows for a single stream at a time. This means that you SHOULD NOT use more than one of these widgets at a time (yet).

If you have any problems with this widget, please don't hesitate to let us know. If you use the widget and like it, please rate it.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `sency` folder and it's contents to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to the "Appearance" section of the WordPress Admin.
4. Click on the "Widgets" sub-navigation.
5. Add the widget from the left on to the sidebar of your choice and rearrange it's position to your liking.
6. Configure the widget to your liking.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I put two Sency widgets in my sidebar and now nothing is showing up. What gives? =

Due to the way this widget interacts with Sency at this point in time, you are limited to using only one feed at a time. Even though it seems to support multiple widgets, that is actually a function of WordPress being able to support it. If anyone knows of a way to disable multiple widget instances using the new Widgets API, please let me know and I'll fix this.

= Widgets? What's a Widget? =

Ok. If you don't see mention of widgets in the WordPress admin, you're not crazy. Most themes utilize the widgets feature of WordPress, but some don't. You'll need to either switch your theme, or find someone who can widgetize your theme for you. If you don't know any widgeteers, let us know and we'll do our best to help you out.
